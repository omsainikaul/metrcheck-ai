**Smart India Hackathon 2026 | Problem Statement: PS 26034 (DoCA / MoCA)**  
**Project:** AI-Assisted Statutory Package Compliance & Enforcement System

---

## 1. Setup & Environment

### Access URLs
| Component | Local URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend Web Application** | `http://localhost:5173` | React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS UI |
| **Backend API Documentation** | `http://localhost:8000/docs` | FastAPI Swagger / OpenAPI Docs |
| **Backend Health Check** | `http://localhost:8000/api/health` | Service & OCR Engine Status |

### Default Demonstration Accounts (RBAC)

| Role | Username | Password | Permissions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Enforcement Officer** | `officer` | `officer123` | Statutory screening, evidence verification, show-cause notices |
| **Audit Officer** | `audit` | `audit123` | Quality inspection, technical rule verification, OCR calibration |
| **Merchant / Public** | `merchant` | `merchant123` | Self-compliance pre-screening & report downloads |
| **Administrator** | Provisioned via CLI — see below | Set during bootstrap | Full system governance, user management, audit logs via `/admin/login` |

> **Note:** Demo officer/merchant accounts are auto-seeded when `METRCHECK_DEMO_MODE=true` is set in `backend/.env`.
> The Admin account is **not** auto-seeded — it must be provisioned separately (once) before the demo:

**Admin Account Bootstrap (run once before demo):**
```bash
cd "d:\SIH\Legal Metrology Compliance AI Prototype\backend"
python -m backend.scripts.bootstrap_admin
```
This interactive script prompts for an admin username, email, and password, then creates the admin account in the database. The password you set here is what you use to log in at `/admin/login`.

### Quick Start Verification
1. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
2. **Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in any modern web browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox).

## 2. Executive Narrative (1-Minute Opening Pitch)

> **"Respected Judges, over 60% of pre-packaged commodities sold in retail markets and e-commerce platforms fail mandatory statutory labeling requirements under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 and FSSAI packaging regulations.**
>
> Today, enforcement officers from the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) and State Legal Metrology Wings are constrained by slow, manual, subjective inspections covering less than 1% of market inventory.
>
> **MetrCheck AI** solves this with an enterprise-grade, automated statutory compliance and enforcement engine:
> 1. **Multi-Pass OCR & Visual Grounding**: Extracts text from multi-panel product packaging with pixel-accurate bounding box evidence.
> 2. **Rule 12 Mathematical Font Calibration**: Converts pixel dimensions to physical millimeters ($mm = px \times \text{factor}$) to verify statutory minimum numeral/letter heights (1.0mm to 6.0mm).
> 3. **Statutory Rule Engine**: Evaluates 10+ Legal Metrology Rules (LM-001 through LM-010) plus FSSAI regulations.
> 4. **Enforcement Automation**: Generates multi-format audit dossiers (PDF/Excel/CSV/JSON) and official Show-Cause Notices under Sections 36 & 38 of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009."

## 3. Step-by-Step Demonstration Walkthrough (10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Login & Role-Based Access Control (00:00 – 01:00)
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/login`.
2. Enter **Username**: `officer` | **Password**: `officer123`.
3. Click the **"Sign In"** button.
4. **Judge Focus**: Point out the active user badge in the bottom-left sidebar: `Enforcement Officer (State Legal Metrology Wing)`. Note that role-based access control (RBAC) restricts administrative actions while exposing enforcement tools like statutory notices.

---

### Step 2: Multi-Panel Package Artwork Analysis (01:00 – 03:00)
1. Click **"Analyze Package"** (`/analyze`) in the sidebar navigation.
2. Observe the multi-panel input slots:
   - **Front Panel (Required)**: Captures Brand, Product Name, Net Quantity, Veg/Non-Veg logo.
   - **Back Panel (Recommended)**: Captures MRP, Dates (Mfg/Expiry), FSSAI Licence No., Manufacturer Address, Ingredients.
   - **Side Panels 1 & 2 (Optional)**: Captures Consumer Care Cell details, Nutritional Facts, Batch No.
3. **Sample Image Selection**:
   - The project repository includes designated test folders in `test_data/`:
     - `test_data/compliant/` — Place compliant package samples here before the demo.
     - `test_data/violation/` — Place violation samples here (missing MRP, incorrect net qty units, missing manufacturer PIN code).
     - `test_data/warning/` — Place borderline samples here (borderline font sizes, missing consumer care email).
   - **Note**: These directories currently contain only `.gitkeep` placeholders. Add representative images before the SIH demo.
   - **Recommended Fallback Images (already in repository)**: Use `backend/fixtures/alpino_front.png` and `backend/fixtures/alpino_back.png`, or drag and drop any packaged food/commodity photograph from your machine.
   - **Demo Mode Fallback**: If no images are available, click **"Demo Mode"** (`/demo`) in the sidebar — pre-verified benchmark analyses load without any file uploads.
4. Click **"Run Statutory Compliance Analysis"**.
5. **Judge Focus**: Watch the real-time pipeline visualizer transition through 8 transparent stages: *Images Received $\rightarrow$ Quality & Blur Check $\rightarrow$ OCR Text Extraction $\rightarrow$ Entity Parsing $\rightarrow$ Legal Metrology Screening $\rightarrow$ Rule 12 Font Height Calibration $\rightarrow$ Dossier Compilation*.

--- 

### Step 3: Executive Dashboard & Score Card (03:00 – 04:15)
1. Click **"Dashboard"** (`/`) in the sidebar.
2. Review the high-level compliance intelligence:
   - **Compliance Health Score Card** (Overall score out of 100).
   - **Key Metrics**: Total Analyzed, Compliant %, Violations %, Average Score.
   - **Recent Statutory Inspections**: Quick access table with timestamp, product name, status badges (`COMPLIANT`, `NON_COMPLIANT`, `WARNING`), and direct links.
3. Click on the latest analyzed product record to open the **Results** page.

---

### Step 4: Deep-Dive Statutory Audit & Rule 12 Font Calibration (04:15 – 06:15)
On the **Results** page (`/results/:id`):
1. **Interactive Evidence Viewer (Visual Grounding)**:
   - Click on the package image or any rule item (e.g., `LM-003 Net Quantity` or `LM-004 MRP`).
   - The viewer highlights the exact bounding box on the original package image where the text was detected, eliminating AI hallucination.
2. **Rule 12 Font Size Analysis Card**:
   - Show the physical font height estimates:
     - **Extracted Net Quantity Height**: e.g., `~3.6 mm` (Statutory Minimum: `2.0 mm` for 100g pack $\rightarrow$ **COMPLIANT**).
     - **Extracted MRP Height**: e.g., `~2.7 mm` (Statutory Minimum: `2.0 mm` $\rightarrow$ **COMPLIANT**).
     - **Readability & OCR Quality Score**: e.g., `88.5 / 100 (EXCELLENT)`.
   - **Judge Focus**: Explain that font height conversion uses the calibrated factor configured in backend settings (`FONT_PX_TO_MM_FACTOR` or `OCR_IMAGE_DPI`), satisfying Rule 12 statutory legibility tables.
3. **Statutory Rule Checklist**:
   - Filter by domain (`Legal Metrology` vs `FSSAI`) or status (`Pass`, `Fail`, `Warning`).
   - Expand `LM-001` (Manufacturer Details), `LM-003` (Net Quantity), `LM-004` (MRP with "inclusive of all taxes"), `LM-005` (Date of Manufacture), `LM-006` (Consumer Care), `LM-007` (Unit Sale Price), `LM-008` (Country of Origin).
4. **Prioritized Corrective Recommendations**:
   - Review actionable, severity-ranked guidance for manufacturers and enforcement officers.

### Step 5: Multi-Format Audit Dossier Export (06:15 – 07:15)
On the top right of the **Results** page:
1. Click **"PDF Report"**:
   - Downloads a formal Government of India / DoCA formatted statutory inspection dossier.
   - Contains executive summary, rule checklist, font analysis table, embedded evidence thumbnail, and a tamper-evident verification QR code.
2. Click **"Excel"**:
   - Downloads an editable multi-tab spreadsheet (`.xlsx`) suitable for departmental record-keeping and bulk audit registers.
3. Click **"CSV Export"** or **"JSON"**:
   - Shows machine-readable exports for integration with state enforcement databases (e.g., National Consumer Helpline / e-Daakhil).

---

### Step 6: E-Commerce Product Listing Text Screening (07:15 – 08:15)
1. Click **"Listing Check"** (`/analyze-listing`) in the sidebar.
2. Explain to the judges: *"E-commerce marketplaces (Amazon, Flipkart, Blinkit, Zepto) list millions of pre-packaged goods. Inspectors need to verify raw listing text instantly without downloading images."*
3. Click **"Load Sample"** (or paste text e.g., `"Maggi 2-Minute Masala Noodles 70g, MRP Rs 14 incl. of all taxes, Mfg: 08/2026, FSSAI Lic 10012011000001, Nestlé India Ltd, 100/101 World Trade Centre, New Delhi 110001, Care: 1800-103-1947 care@in.nestle.com, Country of Origin: India"`).
4. Click **"Analyze Listing Text"**.
5. Observe instantaneous entity extraction and rule validation in < 500 milliseconds.

---

### Step 7: Administrator Governance & User Management (08:15 – 09:00)
1. Navigate to `/admin/login` (or click "Administrator Portal" in footer).
2. Log in with provisioned Administrator credentials.
3. Click **"User Management"** (`/admin/users`) in the sidebar.
4. Demonstrate governance actions:
   - **Create Account**: Add a new officer (e.g., `officer_mumbai`, Role: `Enforcement Officer`, Jurisdiction: `Maharashtra State Legal Metrology Controller`).
   - **Edit / Password Reset**: Update jurisdiction or reset officer credentials.
   - **Role Segregation**: Explain that public merchants cannot access officer notices or user administration.

---

### Step 8: Statutory Enforcement Notice & Penalty Calculation (09:00 – 10:00)
1. Switch back to an inspection result with a non-compliance (or open Demo Case 2 from `/demo`).
2. Logged in as `officer`, click the **"Statutory Notice Draft"** button (Gavel icon).
3. The **Statutory Show-Cause Notice Generator Modal** opens:
   - Displays a formal legal notice referencing **Section 36 & Section 38 of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009**.
   - Includes official Notice Reference Number (`LM/ENF/2026/SCN-...`), Officer ID, Officer Jurisdiction, and itemized statutory violations.
   - Computes compounding penalty estimate under Section 36(1) (₹25,000 for 1st offense, up to ₹50,000 for subsequent offenses).
4. Click **"Copy Notice Text"** or **"Print / Save PDF Notice"** to demonstrate immediate field dispatch.

## 5. Live Demonstration Fallbacks & Resilience Strategies

| Scenario / Potential Glitch | Recommended Fallback Action | Technical Resilience Built-In |
|---|---|---|
| **OCR Processing Delay / Camera Glare** | Use **Listing Check** (`/analyze-listing`) with the pre-loaded sample text. | Listing check bypasses OCR and tests entity parsing & compliance rules instantly. |
| **Zero Image Files Available on Machine** | Click **"Demo Mode"** (`/demo`) in the sidebar $\rightarrow$ select **Case 1 (Compliant)**, **Case 2 (Violation)**, or **Case 3 (Warning)**. | Demo mode loads pre-verified benchmark analyses without requiring file uploads. |
| **No Internet / Offline Venue** | Continue demonstration normally. | System runs **100% locally** (local SQLite DB, local PaddleOCR deep learning engine, local rule evaluator). |
| **LLM API Quota Exceeded / Latency** | System automatically falls back to regex extraction. | Backend includes dual-tier architecture: when LLM API key is empty/fails, regex extractor parses all statutory fields with zero downtime. |

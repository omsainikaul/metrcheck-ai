## Overview

**MetrCheck AI** is an AI-assisted smart automation platform for packaged-product compliance. It combines product images, OCR, computer vision, regulatory rules, and verification sources to extract structured information, evaluate compliance, generate evidence, and support human officer verification and enforcement workflows.

By pairing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with deterministic rule evaluation, computer vision bounding boxes, and multi-role human-in-the-loop verification, MetrCheck AI detects mandatory packaging declarations (such as MRP, Net Quantity, Manufacturer details, Dates, and Customer Care contacts), identifies omissions or formatting defects, and generates an explainable compliance score and audit report.

### How MetrCheck AI Addresses the SIH26202 Concept

The **SIH26202** problem statement focuses on the intelligent use of resources for technological advancement by combining artificial intelligence, exploring multiple sources, and obtaining valuable insights.

**MetrCheck AI** applies this smart automation concept to an end-to-end packaged-product compliance workflow by orchestrating multiple data streams and AI capabilities:

**Sources & Inputs:**
- **Product Packaging Images**: Multi-angle visual labels from retail packaging and e-commerce listings.
- **OCR Text & Spatial Coordinates**: Deep-learning text detection (DBNet) and character recognition (SVTR) via PaddleOCR.
- **Computer Vision Detections**: Spatial boundary mapping, bounding boxes, and evidence cropping.
- **Structured Product Information**: Brand names, product categories, SKU codes, and merchant catalog metadata.
- **Regulatory Rules**: Codified statutory clauses from the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011.
- **FSSAI Verification Data**: License number pattern validation and regulatory verification where configured.
- **GS1 / GTIN Verification Data**: Barcode (EAN-13, UPC, QR) format and check-digit validation.
- **Human Officer Verification**: Audit Officer reviews, evidence validation, and field-level corrections.

**Automated Outputs & Value:**
- **Structured Product Information**: Standardized extraction of MRP, Net Quantity, Dates, Manufacturer/Packer addresses, Consumer Care contacts, and Country of Origin.
- **Compliance Findings**: Instant clause-by-clause evaluation against mandatory statutory rules.
- **Explainable Risk Indicators**: Clear scoring (0–100) with color-coded classification (Compliant, Warning, Violation).
- **Evidence-Backed Results**: Visual bounding-box overlays linked to specific rule evaluations in the Evidence Viewer.
- **Human Verification Records**: Immutable snapshots preserving AI analysis alongside human officer corrections and audit logs.
- **Comprehensive Compliance Reports**: Multilingual PDF and digital audit reports generated across 10 Indic languages and English.
- **Enforcement Case Docket**: Automatic case escalation and workflow tracking for non-compliant commodities requiring formal statutory action.

## Application Domain: Legal Metrology & Packaged Commodity Compliance

Under the Indian Legal Metrology Act and the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, all pre-packaged commodities sold across offline retail and e-commerce platforms must carry explicit mandatory declarations to safeguard consumer rights.

### The Challenge
Manual verification of packaging labels is:
- **Time-Intensive & Expensive**: Inspecting thousands of SKUs across physical retail and e-commerce requires substantial human labor.
- **Error-Prone**: Minor omissions, font size discrepancies, ambiguous addresses, and improper metric units frequently slip past manual review.
- **Inconsistent**: Different inspectors may apply varying levels of scrutiny.

There is a critical need for an automated, objective, AI-driven inspection pipeline capable of ingesting packaging images, extracting declaration text with spatial coordinates, evaluating rules, and flagging non-compliant products instantly while supporting human officer verification and enforcement workflows.

---

## Solution Pipeline

MetrCheck AI implements an end-to-end multi-stage pipeline:

$$\text{Product Image} \longrightarrow \text{OCR Engine} \longrightarrow \text{Information Extraction} \longrightarrow \text{Compliance Check} \longrightarrow \text{Score} \longrightarrow \text{Human Review} \longrightarrow \text{Enforcement}$$

1. **Image Ingestion**: Accepts label images via drag-and-drop or sample selection.
2. **OCR Engine**: Detects raw text fragments and extracts 2D bounding boxes using PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv4 deep learning engine).
3. **Information Extraction**: Employs pattern recognition (regex) and structured parsing to extract key packaging attributes:
   - Maximum Retail Price (MRP inclusive of all taxes)
   - Net Quantity (metric weight, volume, or count)
   - Date of Manufacture / Packing / Import
   - Expiry Date / Best Before period
   - Manufacturer / Packer / Importer Name & Physical Address
   - Consumer Care Details (Phone & Email)
   - Country of Origin
4. **Compliance Check**: Validates extracted data against codified Legal Metrology rules and mandatory declaration requirements.
5. **Scoring & Explainability**: Generates a standardized compliance score (0–100) alongside fine-grained classification:
   - **Compliant**: Mandatory declarations present and valid.
   - **Warning**: Declarations present with non-critical formatting ambiguities or missing optional fields.
   - **Violation**: Missing mandatory declarations or non-standard representations.
6. **Human Verification & Escalation**: Human Audit Officers review findings, correct extracted values, and escalate critical non-compliance to Enforcement Officers.
7. **Report Generation**: Presents visual bounding-box highlights, field-by-field verdicts, and downloadable inspection audit reports in multiple languages.
